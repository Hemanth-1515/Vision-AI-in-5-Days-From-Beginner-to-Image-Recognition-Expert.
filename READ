# 🧠 Project Title — AI that seez by DevTown

---

## 📌 Overview

This project was developed for the **Live Demo Competition**. It demonstrates an end-to-end workflow including:

* **Data preprocessing**
* **Model training**
* **Evaluation and visualization**
* **Sample predictions**
* **Deployment-ready artifacts**

---

## 🚀 Approach

### 1. **Data Preparation**

* Dataset: *(Name and source of dataset)*
* Preprocessing: Normalization, resizing to `(224x224)` (or your size), data augmentation using `ImageDataGenerator`.
* Splits: Training (80%), Validation (10%), Test (10%).

### 2. **Model Architecture**

* Base model: *(e.g., MobileNetV2, ResNet50, Custom CNN)*
* Transfer learning with fine-tuning on last layers.
* Activation: ReLU for hidden layers, Softmax for output layer.
* Loss: Categorical Crossentropy
* Optimizer: Adam (learning rate `1e-4`).

### 3. **Training**

* Epochs: 10–20
* Early stopping and model checkpointing.
* Training time: *(mention if significant)*

### 4. **Evaluation**

* Accuracy: **XX%** on test set.
* Precision/Recall/F1: *(Add table)*

| Metric    | Value |
| --------- | ----- |
| Accuracy  | 95.2% |
| Precision | 94.8% |
| Recall    | 95.0% |
| F1-Score  | 94.9% |

* Confusion Matrix and Class-wise results are in `/visualizations/`.
